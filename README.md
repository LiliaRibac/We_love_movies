This app was created during my time in the Cheggs/Thankful program. It helps you find out what movies are currently showing in different theaters.

Here's what you can do with it:

* Check out details about a movie you're interested in, like what it's about, its rating, how long it is, and what other people think of it.
* Find out which theaters are playing the movie you want to see.
* Read reviews from critics to help you decide if you want to watch a movie.
* Give a thumbs up or thumbs down to a review.
* See a list of all the theaters and the movies they're showing.

The front end was provided and built in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to make things look nice and React to make it all work smoothly.
I worked on BackEnd, ensuring everything ran smoothly; I used Node.js, Express, and Knex.
